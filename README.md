Hi , i'm `Irda Islakhu Afa`

<b>I'm Software Developer</b> from Indonesia. I always like to learn new things in the world of technology. Currenly, i'm focusing on exploring the profession as <b>Backend Developer</b> using `Java` and `Go` Programming languages. Apart from these two languages sometime i learn mobile programming languages such as `Dart` with `Flutter` as `Dart Frameworks`. More than 2 years of experience using `Java` with `Spring Boot Framework` and `Go` native (currently always use `builtin` package from `Go` and some packages from other developers) and always try to improve my skills. I really love this fun profession of being a `Software Developer`. The green dots on my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/irdaislakhuafa) page represent my journey
